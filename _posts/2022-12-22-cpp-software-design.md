## The Art of software design
```
The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system  

Software design is the art of managing interdependencies between software components. It aims at minimizing artificial (technical) dependencies and introduces the necessary abstractions and compromises.

Guildline1: Understand the Importance of Software Design
+ Treat software design as an essential part of writing software.
+ Focus less on C++ language details and more on software design.
+ Avoid unnecessary coupling and dependencies to make software more adaptable to frequent changes.
+ Understand software design as the art of managing dependencies and abstractions.
+ Consider the boundary between software design and software architecture as fluid.
